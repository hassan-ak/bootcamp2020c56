# bootcamp2020c55 - AWS AppSync

## AWS Amplify And AWS Appsync

### Class Notes

CloudFormation was the base solution for infrastructure as code. AWS developed different tools such as amplify whcih is for developers with less grip on AWS, SAM is for serverless people with advantage of local deployment of lambda functions and proton which is for lambda functions and containers. This class is focused on amplify. We are going to use AppSync on client side using amplify. Amplify is a tool that allows us to develope and integrate backend with frontend. Our focus is on developing backend with CDK and use it in frontend using amplify. In case we want our changes to the server side to be reflected on the client side along with queries and mutations we can use subscriptions. Working with AppSync is easy for scalebale subscription. Amplify composes of different things such as amplify CLI and amplify libraries.

Working with GraphQl we have queries and mutations. An other thing to acces the APi in real time is through subscriptions. It is like web socket where we are connected to server all the time. In simple words working with subscriptions give us the opportunity to reflect changes on the server side in real time to the client side.
